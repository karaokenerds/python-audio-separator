- Test running CLI with minimal input file for each major supported model (e.g. at least 1 from each architecture) outputs expected files
- Test running CLI with pre-warmed cache directory containing model files does not repeat download
- Test running CLI with corrupt model files in cache directory throws expected error
- Test loading the separation class rather than using the CLI works as expected with all major supported models
- Test processing multiple files in a row outputs separate expected files
- Test processing file with multiple different models outputs separate expected files
- Test each of the architecure specific parameters works as expected in both CLI and class mode
